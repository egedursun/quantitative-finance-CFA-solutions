You are retiring today and must choose to take your retirement benefits either as
a lump sum or as an annuity. Your companyâ€™s benefits officer presents you with
two alternatives: an immediate lump sum of $2 million or an annuity with 20
payments of $200,000 a year with the first payment starting today. The interest
rate at your bank is 7 percent per year compounded annually. Which option has
the greater present value? (Ignore any tax differences between the two options.)
