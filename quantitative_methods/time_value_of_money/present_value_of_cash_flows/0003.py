A German pension fund manager anticipates that benefits of
 â‚¬1 million per year must be paid to retirees. Retirements
 will not occur until 10 years from now at time  t  = 10.
 Once benefits begin to be paid, they will extend until
 t  = 39 for a total of 30 payments. What is the present
 value of the pension liability if the appropriate annual
 discount rate for plan liabilities is 5 percent compounded
 annually?
